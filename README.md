# mySQL Database & Assets

Darkfall GoogleMaps tiles can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2xRA2XRBSZaWUFJTjR3TTItWEE/edit?usp=sharing). These were generated using Photoshop and the Javascript file in [/docs/tiler.jsx](https://github.com/nazar/DarkFallSage/blob/master/docs/tiler.jsx). The original large map is not available.

The DarkFallSage website is no longer live but the last good mySQL backup can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2xRA2XRBSZaZXhfaldVTDFobW8/edit?usp=sharing) and related game assets files can be downloaded [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2xRA2XRBSZaQmJ4X0JXdklaS1k/edit?usp=sharing).

Please note that the mySQL database contains user registration data with emails addresses stripped for security reasons.
